# Live Contract: Real-time boards

## Socket

`GET /api/boards/{id}/live`, upgraded to a WebSocket. Same origin, authenticated by the `tiko_session` cookie the browser sends with the upgrade; no token in the URL.

| Check at the upgrade | Result when it fails |
|---|---|
| Session (`PasswordGate`) | closed with 1008 before accept |
| `Origin` host equals the request host | closed with 1008 before accept |
| Role on the board at least viewer | accepted, then closed with 4403 |
| Under 30 connections in the room | accepted, then closed with 4429 |

## Messages

Binary frames of the y-websocket protocol, each starting with a varuint message type.

| Type | Message | From a viewer | From an editor or owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0, sync step 1 (0) | state vector | answered with step 2 | answered with step 2 |
| 0, sync step 2 (1) | missing updates | dropped | applied |
| 0, update (2) | document update | dropped | applied and sent to the others |
| 1, awareness | presence states | the tab's own state is sent to everyone, the sender included; states of other tabs in the message are dropped | the same |
| anything else | – | dropped | dropped |

Text frames are ignored. A frame over 1 MiB closes the socket with 1009.

The server sends sync step 1 on accept, then updates and awareness from the others, and its own repair updates.

## Close codes

| Code | Meaning | What the web app does |
|---|---|---|
| 1001, 1006, 1012 | server going away, lost connection | reconnects with backoff up to 2.5 s |
| 1008 | no session or foreign origin | goes to sign-in |
| 1009 | message too big | reloads the board |
| 4401 | the session ended (sign out everywhere, password change, disabled, expired) | goes to sign-in |
| 4403 | the role on this board changed or is gone, or the board was deleted | reads `GET /boards/{id}` again: 404 goes to the board list with "You no longer have access to this board."; otherwise applies `my_role` and connects again |
| 4429 | the room is full | stays view-only on the last saved version with "This board is full right now.", tries again every 30 s |

Codes 4400–4499 are final for the provider: it does not reconnect on its own.

## Awareness state

One state per tab, set by the client, never stored.

```text
{
  user: {id, name, color},       // color: index 0–7 into the presence palette, from the person's id
  cursor: {x, y} | null,         // flow coordinates; null when the pointer is off the canvas
  selected: string[],            // node and edge ids, at most 200
  drag: {[nodeId]: {x, y}} | null  // absolute positions of nodes being dragged
}
```

## REST (changed)

| Method, path | Change |
|---|---|
| `GET /boards/{id}` | unchanged; `doc.viewport` is whatever was last stored and is ignored by the web app |
| `PUT /boards/{id}` | same request and response; a current `version` is applied to the shared doc as one update (people on the board see it), a stale one answers 409 `version_conflict` |
| `DELETE /boards/{id}`, member, everyone, transfer routes | unchanged; they also close or re-check the board's sockets |
| `PATCH /people/{id}`, `POST /auth/logout`, `POST /auth/logout-all`, `PUT /me/password`, reset accept | unchanged; they also close that person's sockets (logout: that session's) |

No new REST route and no new error code.
