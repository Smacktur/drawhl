```

tiko runs as two containers. nginx serves the built UI and proxies `/api` to the API, so the browser sees one origin. The API keeps everything in one SQLite file under `./data`.

The backend has three layers with one dependency rule, `api → domain ← adapters`: the domain knows nothing about FastAPI or any tracker SDK. Wiring happens in `backend/app/main.py`. The reasons behind each choice are in the [decision log](https://github.com/tiko-run/tiko/blob/main/docs/decisions.md).

## Backend

```text
backend/app/
  api/        routes: auth, boards, tasks, jql, settings, people, invites, me, demo, version;
              the sign-in gate and error mapping to HTTP
  domain/     accounts, sessions, invites, members, boards, tasks, refresh and backoff,
              jql, settings, modules, updates; ports.py
  adapters/
    tasks/    jira_dc.py (httpx), demo.py (in-memory seed)
    storage/  sqlite.py, migrations/*.sql (PRAGMA user_version)
    secrets/  fernet.py (token encryption with TIKO_SECRET_KEY)
    releases/ github.py (latest release for "update available")
  config.py   ENV, the single entry point
```

Everything external sits behind a port in `domain/ports.py`. `TaskProvider` is the tracker interface: `resolve`, `poll`, `search`, `check`, plus the query vocabulary and values. The other ports are repositories (`BoardRepo`, `MemberRepo`, `UserRepo`, `SessionRepo`, `InviteRepo`, `CredentialRepo`, `SnapshotRepo`, `SettingsRepo`), `SecretBox` for encryption and `ReleaseFeed` for the update check. The tracker is a runtime setting (`demo` or `jira`), so connecting Jira needs no restart.

The main tables:

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `boards` | One JSON document per board, with a `version` for compare-and-set saves |
| `board_members` | Who can view or edit each board |
| `users`, `sessions`, `invites` | Accounts, sign-ins and one-time links |
| `user_credentials` | Each person's encrypted tracker token |
| `task_snapshots` | Latest fields per task key, kept apart for each person |
| `settings` | Tracker, its URL and the refresh interval |

`/health`, `/ready` and `/metrics` (Prometheus) are served outside `/api`.

## Frontend

```text
frontend/src/
  api/        fetch client, zod schemas
  auth/       sign-in and invite screens
  board/      top bar, board menu, sharing, shortcuts dialog
  canvas/     React Flow canvas, nodes, toolbar, context menu, clipboard, undo history
  modules/    board modules, Gantt first
  timers/     card timers
  focus/      focus timer and player
  search/     the command palette
  settings/   settings sheets
  components/ui/  shadcn components
  lib/        theme, shortcuts registry, query helpers
```

The board lives in React Flow state and is saved as a whole document after a short debounce. A `409` on save means someone else saved first.

## Status refresh

1. Every 30 seconds (a setting), the open board calls `POST /api/boards/{id}/refresh`. Background tabs pause.
2. The API asks the tracker for all cards on the board in one request. For Jira that is `POST /rest/api/2/search` with `key in (...)`.
3. The API returns fresh task snapshots, and the cards update.

That is one batched request per open board per tick. The response lists every tracker with its own state (`sources`), so one failing tracker never hides the others. Backoff lives on the server, per tracker: rate limits and 5xx responses double the wait (it honours `Retry-After`, up to 300 s). Network errors retry at the normal interval, so a VPN coming back shows up on the next tick. The client polls at the interval, or at `retry_after` when a tracker asked to wait.

## Room to grow

None of this is built. It is listed so the current design does not block it.

- For more load, move from SQLite to Postgres behind the same repository ports, run several API replicas, and share refresh results between boards that show the same keys.
- For fewer requests to the tracker, add a server-side poller with a cache per key, or webhooks where admins allow them.
- A new tracker is a new `TaskProvider` adapter, with no changes to the domain. See [Task trackers](../trackers/).
