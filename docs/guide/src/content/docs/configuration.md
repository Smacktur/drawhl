Everything works without a `.env` file. To override defaults, copy [`.env.example`](https://github.com/tiko-run/tiko/blob/main/.env.example) to `.env` next to the compose file and edit it.

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `TIKO_PASSWORD` | Password of the first account, `admin`. When empty, one is generated on first start, printed once to the API log and saved to `data/password`. Not read once the account exists | generated |
| `TIKO_SECRET_KEY` | Encrypts tracker tokens at rest; needed only to connect a tracker (`openssl rand -base64 32`) | unset |
| `TIKO_TRACKER` | Tracker for everyone: `demo` or `jira`. Set, Settings → Task source shows it read-only | set in Settings |
| `JIRA_BASE_URL` | Jira URL for everyone, like `https://jira.example.com`; a wrong URL stops the start. Each person still adds their own token | set in Settings |
| `TIKO_DEMO` | `1` lets anyone start without an account as a demo visitor on the demo tasks, and sign up to stay. See [Running a demo](../demo/) | off |
| `TIKO_BOARD_LIMIT` | Boards a person may own, admins and demo visitors aside | no limit |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Read-only GitHub token that raises the request limit for public issues from 60 to 5000 an hour, so GitHub cards update at the board's pace. See [GitHub Issues](../github-issues/) | unset |
| `JIRA_TLS_VERIFY` | Verify Jira's TLS certificate; `false` skips the check | `true` |
| `JIRA_CA_BUNDLE` | Path inside the container to a CA bundle for a corporate certificate authority | unset |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Log level | `info` |
| `DB_PATH` | SQLite file inside the container | `data/app.db` |
| `APP_ENV` | Environment name: `local`, `stage` or `production` | `local` |
| `UPDATE_CHECK` | Ask GitHub every 6 hours for the latest release to show "update available" in About; `false` turns it off | `true` |
| `TIKO_PORT` | Port on your machine that Docker Compose gives the web UI | `3000` |
| `TIKO_API_PORT` | Port on your machine for the API when you run from source with `docker compose up`. The release compose file does not publish the API | `8000` |

To trust a corporate CA, put the bundle in `./data` (for example `data/corp-ca.pem`) and set `JIRA_CA_BUNDLE=data/corp-ca.pem`.

The refresh interval is set in Settings → Task source, not in the environment.

## Behind your own reverse proxy

Live boards use a WebSocket at `/api/boards/<id>/live`, on the same address as the rest of tiko. The proxy in front of tiko has to pass WebSocket upgrades to the web container (port 3000) and keep idle connections open. Without that, boards open view-only with "Live connection unavailable". Public links use `/api/public/<token>/live` the same way and fall back to checking for changes every few seconds.

Caddy and Traefik pass WebSockets without extra settings:

```text
tiko.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

nginx needs the upgrade headers and a longer read timeout:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
}

server {
    server_name tiko.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_read_timeout 1h;
    }
}
```

Keep the `Host` header as the browser sent it: tiko refuses a live connection whose page address differs from the host it was asked for. Railway, Render and plain `docker compose` need no changes.
